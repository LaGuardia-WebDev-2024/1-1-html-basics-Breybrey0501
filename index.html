  <h1>you make my day</h1>
<p>
  Unintentionally, I was staring at you.
  You noticed that.<br>
  
  then, you raised your eyebrows
       In a way to say hi, <br>
        so no one can hear you 
  As simple as it seems, <br> it wasn't simple for me
   In a tinest moment,<br> 
    Blood rushed to my face; <br>
    I felt terribly warm; 
  My heart went on a marathon for beating. <br>
  I waved my hand a little,
  As a sort reflex <br>
  I felt akward <br>
  Then you waved back at me 
  <em>You waved back.</em>
   I couldn't help but smile <br> A rush of happiness rushing all over my body <br>And my day couldn't get any better
  You really don't know that the mere sight of you <br> <em> Makes my day</em>
