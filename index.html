  <h1>you make my day</h1>
<p>
  Unintentionally, I was staring at you.
  <p>
  You noticed that.<br>
  
  then, you raised your eyebrows
      <p> In a way to say hi, <br>
        so no one can hear you <p>
  As simple as it seems, <br> it wasn't simple for me
  <p> In a tinest moment,<br> 
    Blood rushed to my face; <br>
    I felt terribly warm; <p>
  My heart went on a marathon for beating. <br>
  I waved my hand a little, <p>
  As a sort reflex <br>
  I felt akward <br>
  Then you waved back at me 
  <p>You waved back.
    <p> I couldn't help but smile <br> A rush of happiness rushing all over my body <br>And my day couldn't get any better
      <p> You really don't know that the mere sight of you <br> Makes my day.
